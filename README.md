# admin-dasboard
This repository contains the source code and assets for my Admin Dashboard project, which is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. In this project, I've created an admin dashboard with a focus on utilizing CSS Grid for layout.

The [design reference file](./design.png) was obtained from The Odin Project.
